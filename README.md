# LibraryApplication

It is a simple maven project - no Spring involved.
Inside the app package there's the LibraryApplication with the main method to demonstrate how the application works.

**To build the application from command line:**
mvn clean install

**To run the application from command line:**
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="app.LibraryApplication"

**To run the tests from command line:**
mvn test

Or you can import the project to your IDE and run the LibraryApplication.main method and the tests from there.
